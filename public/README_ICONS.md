# PWA Icons Setup

To complete the PWA setup, you need to create icon files for the app.

## Required Icons

Create the following icon files in the `public` folder:

1. **icon-192.png** - 192x192 pixels
2. **icon-512.png** - 512x512 pixels

## How to Create Icons

You can use the existing logo (`src/assets/cgy_logo_new.png`) as a base:

1. Open the logo in an image editor
2. Resize it to 192x192 pixels and save as `public/icon-192.png`
3. Resize it to 512x512 pixels and save as `public/icon-512.png`
4. Make sure the icons have a transparent or solid background
5. The icons should be square and centered

## Online Tools

- Add the app to their iOS home screen
- Use it as a standalone app
- Install it on Android devices
